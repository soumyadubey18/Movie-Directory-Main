 This project is MOVIE DIRECTORY in which we can give a rating to movie set duration and add movie name as well. The value will be save in Local storage but we can also delete it. There is some validation in rating and duration input and also a searbar where we can search acoording to movie according to Alphabate.

Project status: Currently working on Searching part, so that we can search movie according to alphabate also on validation.
